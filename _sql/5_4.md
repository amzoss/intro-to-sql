## Challenge \#1

Write a query using an aggregate function that returns the number of article titles per ISSNs, sorted by title count in descending order.

Which ISSN has the most titles?

(Hint: choose which aggregate function to use. It is one of the common aggregate functions: `MAX`, `MIN`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, `SUM`.)
