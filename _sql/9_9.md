## Challenge \#2

SQLite has several administrative commands that aren’t part of the SQL standard. One of them is `.dump`, which prints the SQL commands needed to re-create the database. Another is `.read`, which reads a file created by `.dump` and restores the database.

A colleague of yours thinks that storing dump files (which are text) in version control is a good way to track and manage changes to the database. What are the pros and cons of this approach? (Hint: records aren’t stored in any particular order.)
