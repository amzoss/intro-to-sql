## Challenge \#1

Are there other tables and relationships you can create to further normalize the data and avoid inconsistencies?

For this exercise, you can either use pencil/pen and paper to draw new tables and relationships or modify the previous ERD using [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/d/5cc32b0cf7c5bb70c72fc530).
